# Current Topics

I'm interested in a wide variety of research topics, all primarily related to new methods and metrics for evolutionary phenomena that can be expressed mathematically. My current active research projects are:

- Developing metrics, measures, and mechanisms for gene-gene interactions (i.e., my dissertation)
- Investigating the role of "play" and "joy" in open-ended evolution and in evolutionary dynamics more broadly (i.e., video games and evolution)
- Contributing to and creating better resources for written communication in computer science (i.e., why do documentation & textbooks suck so bad?)

# Collaboration

If you are an undergraduate student at Lawrence University interested in collaboration, see the [study](/study) tab.
