Students spend a few hours a week in the classroom; outside of that, they lead rich, complex, and busy lives. Therefore, it is my goal to make student learning both effective and compassionate, so that students can get the most out of the time we have together without sacrificing other aspects of their lives. 

**My goal is for student learning to be evidence-based, mastery-focused, and justice-oriented.** To facilitate this goal, I take an active learning based approach to teaching that centers around promoting metacognition by encouraging peer work and providing individualized feedback.

My teaching revolves around four core components:

1. **Metacognition and student reflection**. I provide opportunities for students to reflect on the process of learning.
2. **Equitable collaboration**. I empower students to see themselves and each other as credible sources of knowledge to combat inequities in group learning.
3. **Accessibility**. Accessibility is a core component of my course design, from multiple modalities to flexible deadlines and attendance.
4. **Ungrading**. I design courses with the intent to evaluate learning objectives holistically, rather than in individual assignments.
