I'm a PhD candidate in [Integrative Biology][ibio] and [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior][eeb] at MSU. My interests are at the intersection of evolutionary biology, computer science, and applied mathematics. In Fall 2022, I'll be starting as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Lawrence University][lawrence]. 

I'm broadly interested in the evolution of genomes and the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping. I'm also interested in higher ed pedagogy and developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses.
