Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Lawrence University][lu]. See _About_ for more.

I regularly teach
	CMSC 140: Intro to Programming with Python, 
	CMSC 150: Intro to Computer Science, 
	and CMSC 270: Data Structures, 
along with upper-level courses in theory and algorithm design. **See _Classes_ for current course websites and past syllabi.**

My research is in developing computational models to study evolutionary phenomena. 
I am also interested in developing new methods of _data interaction_. Data interaction is a broader term for data visualization that takes into account non-visual forms of qualitative sense-making.
